2019-05-23  Jeremy Bennett  <jeremy.bennett@embecosm.com>

	Code for all benchmarks modified to provide a warmup function, to
	allow the caches to be warmed up before we run the benchmark.
	Move all benchmark functions to benchmark_body with a loop counter
	and rewrite benchmark to call benchmark_body with the correct loop
	counter.  Make benchmark_body noinline, so both warmup and
	benchmark invoke the same code and hence warm up the caches
	correctly.

	Provide --enable-warmup function to specify the number of warmup
	loops required, defaulting to 1.

	Wwitch to be better generic functions for initialize_board,
	start_trigger and stop_trigger.

	A general simplification of the benchmark wide scaling.

	We get rid of CALIB_SCALE (benchmark specific calibration for
	particular benchmarks on particular boards). We also replace
	BOARD_REPEAT_FACTOR with CPU_MHZ (a board parameter).  There is
	then no need to compute REPEAT_FACTOR in support.h, we can just
	use CPU_MHz in the benchmarks.

	happy.
